### How I Built It

Laravel was new to me so I leaned on AI for help in getting the application up and running. **_In the spirit of transparency_**, here's a breakdown of what I can take credit for vs. what AI can take credit for:

| Description              | Tom  | AI   |
| ------------------------ | ---- | ---- |
| Laravel Boilerplate code | 0%   | 100% |
| Building the UI          | 95%  | 5%   |
| Connecting the API       | 50%  | 50%  |
| Testing the API response | 100% | 0%   |
| Adding UX functionality  | 100% | 0%   |

In a nusthell, I leaned on AI to help me get the backend up & running, and for some syntax details about how Laravel handles API routes.
